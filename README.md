# 👋 Hey there, curious wanderer of the codeverse!

Welcome to my digital cave of chaos, curiosity, and occasional commits.

## Who am I?

I’m just a college student with a dream, a laptop, and an unreasonable number of Chrome tabs open.  
I don’t know anything/everything (yet), but I’m that kind of person who can learn anything once I *really* want to.  
And trust me—I want to.

- I don’t know everything.  
  In fact, I still get excited when my code runs without throwing an error.  
- But I love learning new stuff — frameworks, tools, shortcuts, you name it.  
  (Except recursion. Recursion scares me. So does recursion.)
- I might not be a pro yet, but give me some time (and YouTube tutorials),  
  and I’ll be building things that even my future self will be like: “yo... nice.”

## What do I do here?

I tinker, I break things, and sometimes, I fix them too.  
I build fun stuff, learn from even more fun stuff, and occasionally pretend I know what I’m doing. (Spoiler: I Google a lot. We all do.)

Some of my favorite things to explore:

- 💻 Coding projects that start as “bro this is easy” and end with “bro this is rocket science”
- 🧩 Algorithms that make me question my existence
- 🛠️ Tech stacks that I swear I’ll master this semester (for real this time)
- 🎨 UI/UX because making it *look good* is half the battle won


## Life Motto

> "If I can laugh about it, I can learn from it."

Also, my IDE crashes sometimes, but my vibe never does.

## 📚 I'm Currently Into...

- Exploring frameworks I can barely pronounce at first
- Writing code that sometimes works... eventually
- Making projects that start with “what if…” and end with “oh wow!”
-  Why CSS is both a blessing and a personal attack
- If coffee counts as a tech stack
- Whether I'm building a project or just opening VS Code to stare at it


## 🧬 My Superpowers (in progress... updates weekly)

- Curiosity level: 7000+  
- Debugging patience: slowly increasing  
- Meme generation rate: depends on caffeine


## Why should you care?

Because I’m not just here to code — I’m here to grow, build cool things, share even cooler ones, and maybe one day contribute something that actually helps someone.

So if you're here to collaborate, learn, or just vibe with a fellow student trying to figure it all out —  
**Welcome aboard.** Let's do something awesome.

- 📬 [Reach me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/piyushtakrani2805/) *(once I fix my bio... it's a work in progress ok?)*
- 🐦 Instagram? Maybe later. For now, I'm just chasing deadlines and debugging life.

**P.S.**: If you're reading this and thinking "hmm, this person seems fun to work with" — you're absolutely right.
